**Task**
We need an application for a teacher to assign students to groups for a project.


**Functional requirements**
1. On first visit a teacher should create a new project by providing a title of the project and
a number of groups that will participate in the project and a maximum number of
students per group. Groups should be automatically initialized when a project is created.
2. If the project exists, a teacher can add students using the “Add new student” button.
Each student must have a unique full name.
3. All students are visible on a list.
4. Teacher can delete a student. In such a case, the student should be removed from the
group and project.
5. Teacher can assign a student to any of the groups. Any student can only be assigned to
a single group. In case the group is full, information text should be visible to a teacher.
6. The page is operational and publicly accessible.

**Bonus requirements**
1. Make information on the status page to automatically update every 10 seconds.
2. Implement functional requirement #2 using RESTful API.
3. Add automated test for functional requirement #4.
